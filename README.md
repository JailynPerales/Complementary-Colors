# Complementary-Colors
This program takes the users choices from the dropdown and output whether those two colors are complementary colors or not.
My project takes the two options the user picks from the drop downs and outputs either “Perfect Match!:)” if they are complementary colors or “Try Again:(“ if they are not. The user can keep going through picking different options and find all the pairs. This project could be useful or helpful for people either needing to learn the complementary colors or people who are simply just curious.
